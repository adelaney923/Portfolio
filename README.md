## Project Description

This project is a personal portfolio website where I will be creating a space to highlights projects that I have created.  This site will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  While creating my website I will be thinking about making it user friendly and easy to navigate, while including responsive design to make it more interesting and exciting to explore.
